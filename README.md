# Merkle Trees in Plonky2

## Examples

The `examples` folder contains separate Plonky2 examples that explore how it can be used. They either contain a `main` function, or test functions in the file. In both cases, they can be run from your IDE clicking on `Run` or `Run test`.

## Notes

Plonky repo: https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2/tree/main.

`rust-toolchain` has been added, since plonky2 currently doesn't run on stable.
